>>>>Design of collection name change --> '__' should be replaced with "pl."
    Need to change in DB, client side, test cases, collection definition, Need to inform wfparties
>>>>Design of _id as object id of mongo  and will be assigned to Sachin
    Query
        Find time/date info from obejectid field
        _id :""
            if it is objectid, do nothing
            if it is string --> try to cast it in objectid, if error do nothing otherwise it is objectid now
            key==_id or ends with ._id
            cases
                Array in
                _id
                Fk
                And
                OR
                Group query with match or having filter
                Pipeline
    Saving
        __id of self in collection and array (datatype), users in db --> new objectid
        FK --> No issue
        Test cases to ensure objectid if _id not passed

    get changed collection
        one function for getting all application names where something changed, fields, actions or collection ,

            __delete__ --> delete
            update --> if value is obejct then it should be moved to $set
            array -->
                insert --> array insert
                update --> array update with $set
                delete --> array delete
